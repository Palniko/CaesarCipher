It's an simple kryptology project using QT framework based on Caesar cipher but not using alphabet but charset.
# about CaesarCipher ðŸ‘€
The Caesar cipher was one of the first known encryption methods, used by Julius Caesar to secure military messages. It is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. Due to its simplicity, it is easy to break but played a significant role in the early history of cryptography. For example, with a shift of 3, A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. It is easy to implement but also easy to break due to its limited number of possible shifts (only 25).
